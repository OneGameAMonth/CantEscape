# I Can't Escape

My January game for OneGameAMonth, I Can't Escape is a first person horror game, with an interesting twist.

You can play the current build of the game here: http://fancyfishgames.com/ICantEscape/

It requires Flash Player 11 and uses Stage3D

The code will not be very well documented, as it's more of a rapid prototype (one month) than a full game.
